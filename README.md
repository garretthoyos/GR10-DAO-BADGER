# Hackathon: GR10: Badger DAO Art Bounty
Ethereum Ship comes to face off the Bitcoin Castle but instead of war, a Badger summons the magic technological fungi to create a bridge between the two and prevent war. 

VR Quill movie for Badger DAO Art Bounty on Gitcoin. With love for everyone who is creating the metaverse. Together we are unstoppable.

I created this using Quill 100% in Virtual Reality. 

Several Quill assets were created and purchased on Gumroad by other Quill artists but modified to fit my scene. I paid approximately $170 to finish this piece plus my own time. I had a blast doing it. Can't wait for the next bounty.

I had some help from my editor to put together the making of video. 

I've submitted one work without music & one with music since the music was licensed to me by Envato Elements (not sure the coypright/creative attribution rules for this). 

Instead of showing the future of work, I decided to just go ahead and become the future of work - I believe the future is already here where artists are able to create 3D infinite worlds of our own imagination. Cryptocurrency and web 3.0 is here - the metaverse is being created by us already - this is just one example - although you don't the future of work or how this will benefit the world I hope through this demonstration you can see that in a matter of hours a single artist can begin to create a film that once took an army of 3D artists. 

Next steps beyond the scope of this submission: Import into Unreal Engine and make it look realistic with raytraced lighting. 
Publish a separate Quill Scene to Oculus Quill Theatre for an immersive 3D experience.
